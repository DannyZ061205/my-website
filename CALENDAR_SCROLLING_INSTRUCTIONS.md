# Calendar Module - Horizontal Scrolling Feature

## What's Been Implemented

Your calendar module now has enhanced scrolling capabilities:

### ✅ Horizontal Scrolling for Days
- **Mouse/Trackpad**: Scroll horizontally through the week days while keeping the time column fixed on the left
- **Shift + Scroll**: Hold Shift and use vertical scroll to scroll horizontally
- **Keyboard**: Use Left/Right arrow keys to scroll horizontally when the calendar is focused
- **Touch**: Swipe left/right on touch devices to navigate between weeks

### ✅ Fixed Time Column
- The time column (showing hours) stays fixed on the left side during horizontal scrolling
- Only moves when you scroll vertically to see different hours
- Always visible for time reference

### ✅ Synchronized Vertical Scrolling
- When scrolling vertically, both the time column and day columns move together
- Smooth synchronization between time indicators and calendar events

## How to Test

1. **Open the app** at http://localhost:3006
2. **Navigate to the calendar module**
3. **Test horizontal scrolling**:
   - Use your trackpad/mouse to scroll horizontally (if your device supports it)
   - Hold Shift + scroll vertically to scroll horizontally
   - Use Left/Right arrow keys
4. **Test vertical scrolling**:
   - Scroll up/down normally - notice the time column moves with the content
5. **Test the fixed time column**:
   - When scrolling horizontally, observe that the time column stays in place

## Visual Enhancements

- **Scroll Indicators**: Subtle gradient indicators appear on the sides when more content is available to scroll
- **Smooth Scrolling**: All scrolling actions are smooth and responsive
- **Custom Scrollbar**: Styled scrollbar that matches the calendar's blue theme

## Browser Compatibility

- Works best in modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Horizontal scrolling with trackpad gestures is supported on macOS and Windows with precision touchpads
- Keyboard navigation works on all platforms

## Additional Features

- The calendar automatically sets a minimum width (1400px) to ensure there's content to scroll when viewing all 7 days
- In single-day view mode, horizontal scrolling is disabled as it's not needed
- The implementation preserves all existing calendar functionality (drag to create events, resize events, etc.)
